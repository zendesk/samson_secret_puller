# SamsonSecretPuller

Library to read secrets generated by the puller.

 - When `/secrets` folder exists it will wait for it to be filled and then build
 a key-value list of secrets.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `samson_secret_puller` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:samson_secret_puller, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `samson_secret_puller` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:samson_secret_puller]]
    end
    ```

  3. Call `fetch_secrets!` to wait for the secrets to appear:

    ```elixir
    secrets = SamsonSecretPuller.fetch_secrets!
    ```
